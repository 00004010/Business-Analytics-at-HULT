    "    Hi dear player! This is the Death Valley Game Show. A player will be given a\n",
    "    chance to escape the Death Valley and is able to win $100,000. Yeap, it is\n",
    "    fancy. The game involvess three stages. The first two stages are guessing \n",
    "    the given object or tasks. The last round is question based where a player will \n",
    "    be asked a logic question. Here are the each stage's brief explanation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Round #1: Player guesses whether it is night or day outside. A player has\n",
    "    been being kept in the valley for about 15 days so that this is the challenge \n",
    "    fro one who spent his half month in the dark areas. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Round 2: This round is fun too:). As you know player will receive $100,000\n",
    "    if he/she son the game. In this stage, a player guesses the cyrrency type\n",
    "    of the winner prize. Another stupid question given by the Rublex (angel in\n",
    "    the Death Valley).  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Round 3: This round comes up with the logic question. Really fun. Looks\n",
    "    like the question is challenging but trust me extreme simple:). \n",
